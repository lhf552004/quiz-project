## Documentation for Single Quiz Page - Individual Submission

Task Card in Kanban board [Kanban Board Task Card](https://github.com/MUN-COMP6905/project-eteam/issues/31)

I also commented what need to improve and be done in the next sprint in that task card. 

The PR for the quiz task. [PR Task](https://github.com/MUN-COMP6905/project-eteam/pull/49)
- I made a mistake in this PR of miscommunication with a team member who built the routers. His PR came right after mine that causes conflicts.  
- We talked in team chat and decided to make sure he will have all of the route done and connect with blank pug file in the future so his routers would work correctly, and the front-end dev can just go in to build the view instead of blocking and conflict code of each other. 
- As a more experience front-end dev, I merged my PR in without another front-end dev review so we have a reference for other front-end devs to use. 
- However I'll need to have other front-end devs to review my PR before merging. 

The PR for comments to follow TOD [PR comment task](https://github.com/MUN-COMP6905/project-eteam/pull/56/files)

The route for this view right now is [/quiz/1](http://localhost:3000/quiz/1)

The task is complete with the original purpose for sprint #1: Making sure we have a UI done first
