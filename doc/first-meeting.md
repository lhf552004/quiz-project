## First Meeting

### 2/17/2023

Setup the Kanban for the project

### 2/18/2023

#### Meeting prepare

I think at the first meeting we need to define the documents 

1. Meeting Roles

2. Architecture and Code design
    
    Here is my suggestions, please brain storm
    
    1. Use [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework or [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 

    2. Store data in database, for example postgres,

    3. update the UML: user, quiz, quizitem 

    4. Modules: 

        Users: including login, sigup, profile

        Quiz: multiple choice page, calcuate marks for user, create, edit, delete quiz, assign quiz item to quiz

        QuizItem: create, edit, delete quizitem pages


3. Establish Code Review Standards

    Follow prof's rule

4. Establish a source submission process

    Follow prof's rule
    
5. Establish process schedule


### 2/20/2023

   Held the meeting

#### Meeting record

1. We set up the roles for all team members.

2. We created source control process documents and code review rule documents; other documents remain original.
3. we agreed to adopt the express.js framework and view engine pug.
4. we wanted to implement persistence through the database, maybe firebase.
5. To make it easier to achieve for assignment 2, we wanted to only implement one UI for the multiple choice questions function, The UI should give a result after clicking submit button.
6. we created as many tasks as we could into the backlog and picked the tasks mentioned above to do in the current sprint.
7. We set the sprint duration to two weeks.
8. We wanted to hold the scrum meeting once per sprint but will hold a second meeting in the second week if necessary.(Not enough)
