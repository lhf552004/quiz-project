#### Meeting prepare

I think at the first meeting we need to define the documents 

1. Meeting Roles

2. Architecture and Code design
    
    Here is my suggestions, please brain storm
    
    1. Use [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework or [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 

    2. Store data in database, for example postgres,

    3. update the UML: user, quiz, quizitem 

    4. Modules: 

        Users: including login, sigup, profile

        Quiz: multiple choice page, calcuate marks for user, create, edit, delete quiz, assign quiz item to quiz

        QuizItem: create, edit, delete quizitem pages


3. Establish Code Review Standards

    Follow prof's rule

4. Establish a source submission process

    Follow prof's rule
    
5. Establish process schedule
