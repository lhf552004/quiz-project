TEAM E checkout f1458ecdd987cdfa1a0ee87d86e7be18d318889d

- met with trangv on apr 13, code reviews are in pull request. Status in individual submissions, do not reflect connection between back end and front end. Need to update marks for code review and regression tests

## Team submission

_Thanks for making this easy to follow, with very clear yet concise meeting notes, and everything follows neatly from there._

_I could not find the code reviews.  Did you consduct them? Am I missing something here?_

_I could not get the functionality of your front end pages to work for registration, login, and so on. Your status says this is all working, so maybe I need some help setting it up. You should book a demo time for the last submission to make sure I can get it running. I will assume your code is working as reported for now, but I will not do that on the final submission, so someone should set that meeting after the 17th to demo your final product._

_You lost marks on the unit tests because there is no instruction on running them and I can not tell what tests go with what task.  If I missed something in the documentation, point it out and I will restore those marks._

Team submission evaluation will be based on the following:

* The README file in your repo will be read by the evaluator to run the program, unit tests, and find out what other documentation the evaluator should read.
  * The content of the Kanban Board, issue tracker, and repo will be reviewed, but you may need to identify particular uses (of KanBan cards, issue tracker or other documentation tools) in your process documents or README.
  * Other documents can/should be put in a documents folder in your repo
  * If you are using other github tools that need to be reviewed (e.g. discussion or wiki tools) make sure this is made clear to the evaluator in the repo README file.

* Evaluation components will include:
  * (10/10%) Are the SCRUM meetings documented and all decisions documented properly and reflected in the Kanban Board and the issue tracker? Are decisions recorded in manner that provides for validation and traceability?
  _isn;t clear if you moved the note taker role around_
  * (5/10%) Are progress (individual tasks), performance (how did the team members perform) and code reviews conducted and documented, including the following:
    * This should be the primary agenda of the end-of-sprint SCRUM meeting.
    * Each code task has been code reviewed explicitly
    * Each team member has been performance reviewed explicitly (identify them)
    * The review process (x2) is identified, and may include a checklist for guidance and normalizing the review activity.
    _did not find the code review materials_
    * The process should be clear and concise, allowing the opportunity for the individual to respond to specific problems. (a full page of criticism is too long.)
    * Issues that arise from code and/or performance review are noted in the board.
  * (50/50%) Are the appropriate process elements established, followed and documented
    * (5/5%) meetings conducted appropriate contributions, with roles, notes and all decisions documented
    * (5/5%) Scrummaster and notetaker roles properly conducted and circulated among team members
    * (5/5%) Current architecture and technology base (languages, modules, packages, tools) for project design described (including diagrams where needed) 
    * (5/5%) pull request deadlines and process and other workflow elements (git workflow) described and enforced for all team members _I did not notice specific dates for these, but I may have simply missed them._
    * (5/5%) code review standards clear and identified (possibly using a checklist) encapsulating principles from lecture materials (DRY, SOLID, etc.) updated and enforced by review
    * (25/25%) documentation, Kanban Board and issue tracker
      * labels and organization of issues in the tracker and cards on the board should be clear to the evaluator.
      * Completeness - the progress of tasks and issue status are clear from the board.
      * Labels have been modified for the team process. Labels help distinguish types of issues and tasks.
      * The board is clearly being used to update status and labels of tasks, and new cards identifying issues that arise are posted. 
      * Kanban task documentation can be linked to other more detailed documentation via card comments and web/http links.
  * (10/10%) Are any problems with the team progress, dynamics and process identified and documented along with status of these issues being clearly indicated _would like to see code review issues appear on the board not just performance issues_
  * (10/20%) Unit testing
    * unit testing has been incorporated into code review and completed successfully for all coding tasks.
    _See concerns about task/test co-ordination in general comments above; additionally many of tests indicated working reported as failing for me. It seems like tests were done by some memebrs, but never really co-ordinated in style and structure._
