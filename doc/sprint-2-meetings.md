# Sprint 2 Meetings 

Because of time conflicts between team members, we had a first meeting for our sprint 2 a bit later. We decide to have 2 meetings per week on Monday and Friday at 9:30pm. Because our very first meeting is on Mar 15th (Wed) so we decided to skip that week Friday meeting, since 2-day is too short for a sprint process update meeting.
