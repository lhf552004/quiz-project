## Performance Review For Sprint 2

The Performance Review of Each Team-Member can be seen in the mentioned link: [Sprint 2 Performance Review](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gm-qb7FD2baLD-eDKrLjbsh3EBmGTTs08O_xN5u_UjA/edit?resourcekey#gid=104030491)

1.  The above link is a google spreadsheet which consist of all the details on performance review given by each team member to every other team member.

2.  To review each team member we gave used the same methodology which we had used in sprint 1, that is, submit review via google form. This will add the entries (reviews given by every team member) in the google spreadsheeted.

    1.  Here is the link of the google form we have used for submitting the performance review: (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfEb9aKNyQIAktjcmgxnagkp2h6z5cQ48h5fUTlPTktAxgYA/viewform)

3.  This spreadsheet is used recording performance review and keeping track on the performance of every team member. This will help us to know who is performing low consistently.

4.  This spreadsheet will clarify the expectations for the team member's performance, so that they know what is expected of them and can work towards meeting those goals.

5.  From the recorded response in google spreadsheet, following points can be recognised as improvements need to be done as a team:

    1.  Need to put more efforts to learn more about Git, and how to use it well.

    2.  Need to follow the deadline and submit it on time. 

    3.  Although, communication is improved in this sprint as compared to other, still more efforts are required in team communication if stuck somewhere, so that it will result in timely submission.

    4.  Need to be more responsible while merging PR in dev.

6. This process of documenting and recording the performance with the help of google form and spreadsheet will help in improving the team performance and realising where the team is lagging as a whole and can be handled it appropriately.
