# Sprint 2 First Meeting 

Scrum Master + Note Taker: Trang V. 

## Discussion about what was missing from sprint 1 

- Take turn to be Scrum Master and Note Taker for each meeting

- Using checklist for code review 

- Direct and clear communication between Front-End and Back-End Devs

## Discussion about ways to improve Sprint 1 Issue. 

- Communication: 
    - MUST get back to other team member when you are their blockers in 4-8 hours if you are not busy. Please still drop a quick response about when you can get back to them.
    - Check Kanban board a lot more. Move all team communication to the board. Only use group chat for general question so we can keep all team process documented on the board.
    - If someone doesn't get back to you and become a blocker, create an issue task and set them as the asignee. As the prof said, we can't hide the issues and also not fixing them. 
    - If you see anything that needs to be done (missing docs, anything isn't right), be the first one do it, and ask the team to review your work. Can't wait around for someone to do it. It's a group effort. If you can't do it or don't have the knowledge to do it, let the person that should be able to do it know that it needs to be done. But again, divide the works, we can't keep asking the same person to do everything, especially non-technical docs. 

- Code Reivew and PR: 
    - When you are asked as a reviewer, get back to that member as soon as you can. Can't be more than 12 hours or even 8 hours, if we want to strictly enforce that PR can't be merged until approved, you have to review a PR quickly. 
    - When your reviewer requested change/reject your PR, get back to your task and fix it as soon as possible. It's your own individual grade. And if your code is not up to standard, it will affect both you and the whole team.  And we will have to create an issue ticket if something doesn't work correctly on the due date.

- Missing / Weak Documentations: 
    - No documents about using the API. How can I make a get call to get the right answer? How can we check if the login is correct? A docs MUST be provided. Or a very good regression test has to be provided for the front-end team to know how to use it. 
    More external information: https://stoplight.io/api-documentation-guide
    Example of an API doc: What is required parameters, what is the endpoint, how can I call it. If I have to read your code to understand it, it's not a good docs

- Learn more about our stack:
    - We are all learning here. Team members are there to help you, but you also have to learn it by yourself. It's the best way to learn.
    - If you get stuck after trying, ask questions early instead of the day before your deadlines. If they can't answer your questions or you still have doubt, ask the professor. 

## Discussion about deadlines and choosing tasks 

- SHOULD finish one of the tasks after each sprint's week, but not a must since some tasks might take longer to finish. If there is any blocker, you need to document the blockers and tag the responsible person as needed. 

- EVERYTHING needs to be done by _**March 25th**_ so we can start a final code review and performance reviews. If you are late or not done, an issue ticket will be made, you can put your explanations and reasons there for the grader to know. 

- Code review should be done for each PR, but I think we should have 1 last one as a whole to document anything that need to be improved.

- Update all of the existing docs as needed

- This sprint is 30% of our grade, so let's try our best!! 


## Decision from the meeting 

Sukrut - Regression Test for his models
Neha - Connection to the database for create an account screen 
Anton - Documentation for Login and make sure login is working properly 
Yawen - Create tests and provide instruction on how to use his
